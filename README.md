> "I have a 3DS and way too much free time."

## Why?
I was talking with my friend tSaturn, about how I wanted to write more C, and I thought... "y'know what I need in life? Tripletail FM for the 3DS." You can listen, and chat with the Tripletail community, on a screen that's 800x240 lol

After hours of fighting with `libctru`, `citro2d`, and `mbedtls`, it works kinda!

## Features
- **Dual Screen Support**: One screen for the music, one screen for the chat
- **Opus Decoding**: What screams homebrew more than using modern codecs on an old handheld? The CPU is probably sweating lmao
- **Realtime Chat**: Type messages using a stylus like you're sending a Swapnote in 2011
- **Cover Art**: See the beautiful album art in all its 128x128 glory

## FAQ
**Q: Is this better than just using a phone?**  
A: yes.. no. YES.

**Q: Can I use this for hours?**  
A: I have no clue?? maybe if you have it plugged in lmao

- **libctru**: ACTUALLY GOATEDD WORKKKKKK
- **citro2d**: SO GLAD THIS EXISTS, THANK YOUUUUU CITRO2D
- **mbedtls**: yet again, i am so glad a lightweight embedded ssl library exists
